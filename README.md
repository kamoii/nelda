# ðŸš§ Nelda: Experimental fork of Selda
**WARN: WIP**

[Selda](https://github.com/valderman/selda) is a Haskell library for interacting with SQL-based relational databases.
Compared to other haskell type-safe SQL libraries, for example Beam and Opaleye, `Selda` feels more lightwieght and simple. But to keep the library ease of use, there is some tradeoffs.


This fork aims experiment with a different tradeoff while trying to keeping the simplicity of `Selda` as possible.
The major differences are:

* Seperate code to implement per-DB features
* Use Extensible Record to represent (named)sets of column. Currently using [jrec](https://github.com/juspay/jrec).
* Value-level table schema definition instead of using record data type.

# Status quo

* Sample works(`selda-try`'s `Main.hs`)
* Only SQLite supported
* Some features don't work(e.g. JSON)

# How it looks like

This is how Selda's [sample](https://selda.link/) looks like with Nelda.

```haskell
data Pet = Dog | Horse | Dragon
    deriving (Show, Read, Bounded, Enum)
    deriving SqlType via SqlTypeDeriving.TextEnum Pet

people :: _
people = table #people
    ( column #name T.text & notNull & primary
    , column #age  T.int  & notNull
    , column #pet  (T.text & asSqlType @Pet) & default_ Dog
    )

test :: IO _
test = withSQLite "people.sqlite" $ do
    createTable people

    insert_ people
        [ Rec (#name := ("Velvet" :: Text), #age := (19 :: Int), #pet := Just Dog)
        , Rec (#name := "Kobayashi",        #age := 23,          #pet := Just Dragon)
        , Rec (#name := "Miyu",             #age := 10,          #pet := Nothing)
        ]

    query $ do
        row <- select people
        restrict $ row.age .>= 18
        pure row
```

# Motivation
## Implemeting perDB features by seperating code

### NOTE: Backpack
I was first trying to use [Backpack](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/backpack),
but stop using since it didn't support recursive component,
and lack of supports from build tools(e.g. `stack`) and `HLS`/`ghcide`.

## Utilize Extensible Record(jrec)
## Value-level table schema definition
# Other difference from Selda
## Dropped inductive tuple and supported normal tuple instead

Selda uses *Inductive Tuple* (e.g. `a :*: b`) at the boundary of `JOIN`, `AGGREGATE` and `QUERY`.
Inductive tuples can have arbitrary length unlike normal tuples where you have limit of 62.
Also, this a internal thing but, implementing type class instances or type families for inductive tuple is quite simple and clean
compared to normal tuple where you need definition for each tuple size you want to support.

But there are some drawbacks:

* Syntax noiseness.
`a :*: b :*: c` is noisy and unnatural compared to `(a, b, c)`.
* Can only take values out by pattern matching.
Pattern matching against tuples larger than certain size starts to become error-prone,
especialy when the values tend to have same types.

Therefore, Nelda dropped inductive tuple support and instead supported normal tuple(e.g. `(a, b)`) upto 8-tuple.
If you want more than 8 `Col s a`'s to cross the boundary, explicity name each `Col s a` and build (or add to existing) `Row s a` is recomended way
(or you can use nested tuples, but then you have the same problem as indecture tuple).
