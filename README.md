# ðŸš§ Nelda: Experimental fork of Selda
**WARN: WIP**

[Selda](https://github.com/valderman/selda) is a Haskell library for interacting with SQL-based relational databases.
Compared to other haskell type-safe SQL libraries, for example Beam and Opaleye, `Selda` feels more lightwieght and simple. But to keep the library ease of use, there is some tradeoffs.


This fork aims experiment with a different tradeoff while trying to keeping the simplicity of `Selda` as possible.
The major differences are:

* ~~Use GHC's [Backpack](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/backpack)~~ Seperater code to implement per-DB features
* Use Extensible Record to represent (named)sets of column. Currently using [jrec](https://github.com/juspay/jrec).
* Value-level table schema definition instead of using record data type.

# Status quo

* Sample works(`selda-try`'s `Main.hs`)
* Only SQLite supported
* Some features don't work(e.g. JSON)

# How it looks like

This is how Selda's [sample](https://selda.link/) looks like with Nelda.

```haskell
data Pet = Dog | Horse | Dragon
    deriving (Show, Read, Bounded, Enum)
    deriving SqlType via SqlTypeDeriving.TextEnum Pet

people :: _
people = table #people
    ( column #name T.text & notNull & primary
    , column #age  T.int  & notNull
    , column #pet  (T.text & asSqlType @Pet) & default_ Dog
    )

test :: IO _
test = withSQLite "people.sqlite" $ do
    createTable people

    insert_ people
        [ Rec (#name := ("Velvet" :: Text), #age := (19 :: Int), #pet := Just Dog)
        , Rec (#name := "Kobayashi",        #age := 23,          #pet := Just Dragon)
        , Rec (#name := "Miyu",             #age := 10,          #pet := Nothing)
        ]

    query $ do
        row <- select people
        restrict $ row.age .>= 18
        pure row
```

# Motivation

ðŸš§

## Implemeting perDB features by Backpack
## Utilize Extensible Record(jrec)
## Value-level table schema definition

# Things TODO

* [x] ENUM support(TEXT type backend)
* [X] Table creation
* [X] Add more column-level constraints/attirbutes
* [ ] Add Table-level constraints/attributes
* [ ] MySQL backend support
* [ ] PostgreSQL backend support
* [ ] Add more columns type
* [ ] Table validation
* [ ] JP -> EN (README, comments)
* [ ] Table migration
* [ ] JSON support
* [ ] ENUM support(PostgreSQL)
* [ ] Tests
